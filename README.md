# RedSrc

RedSrc is the open-source codebase for a **Survivor Extraction** game built with Godot Engine 4.5.1 (.NET). The commercial implementation is called **RedGate**.

The game combines elements of extraction shooters and the survivors genre (à la Vampire Survivors) where players must extract from dangerous situations while managing resources and fighting waves of hostile entities.

> **⚠️ This project is heavily a work in progress - not only is it not feature complete but is currently not operational.**
