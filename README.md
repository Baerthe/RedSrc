# RedSrc
RedSrc is a Survivors-like top-down 2D game template, with plans to expand into an 8-bit real-time tactical strategy (RTS) game.

The project is currently using open assets. The Code is open source using Godot Engine 4.5.1 .net and licensed under AGPL-3.0-only.

### This project is heavily a work in progess, not only is it not feature complete but is currently is not operational.

## RTS Game Development

We are developing a classic RTS game inspired by Command & Conquer and Warcraft 2/3, featuring:
- **8-bit pixel art aesthetic** using Kenney's 1-bit asset pack
- **Two playable factions** (Humans and Orcs) with distinct units and buildings
- **Classic RTS mechanics**: resource gathering, base building, unit production, and tactical combat
- **AI opponents** with multiple difficulty levels
- **Campaign mode** with story-driven missions
